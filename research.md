## Research Interests

I have worked on many different topics, from **nuclear theory**, to **Early Universe cosmology**, and **Relativistic Astrophisics**, always with a focus on the application of the geometry and dynamics of topological solitons to these fascinating areas .

My current interests include:

- **Topological Defects in cosmology** Their formation, evolution and implications for primordial black holes and gravitational waves
- **Relativistic Astrophysics** and the universal relations satisfied by compact objects such as neutron or boson stars.
- **Nonperturbative aspects of Quantum Field Theory** such as instanton effects or particle production in nontrivial backgrounds.
- **Nuclear theory and skyrmions**

## Selected Projects

###  Primordial Black Holes from domain walls and cosmic strings

> *Can PBHs have been formed from the self intersection of domain wall networks during the Early Universe evolution?*
In this ongoing project, I explore how

###  Dynamics of topological solitons and effective models

###  Quantum field theory and solitons

> *What are the quantum corrections to semi-classical static properties and dynamical processes of solitons in quantum field theory ?*

Solitons are typically treated as classical solutions of QFT, but quantum effects may alter their properties and dynamics. A general framework to study such corrections perturbatively in the coupling constant of the corresponding model has only been recently proposed.
