## Research Interests

I have worked on many different topics, from **nuclear theory**, to **Early Universe cosmology**, and **Relativistic Astrophisics**, always with a focus on the application of the geometry and dynamics of topological solitons to these fascinating areas .

My current interests include:

- **Topological Defects in cosmology** Their formation, evolution and implications for primordial black holes and gravitational waves
- **Relativistic Astrophysics** and the universal relations satisfied by compact objects such as neutron or boson stars.
- **Nonperturbative aspects of Quantum Field Theory** such as instanton effects in qft or particle production in nontrivial backgrounds.
- **Nuclear theory and skyrmions**

## Selected Projects

### ðŸŒ€ Primordial Black Holes from domain walls and cosmic strings

> *Can PBHs have been formed from the self intersection of domain wall networks during the Early Universe evolution?*

In this ongoing project, I explore how
